Altered the original VirtualPet project. Removed tiredness. Simplified some code to better fit the current project. Created new tests/fixed older tests. Added accessor methods.

Created a VirtualPetShelter class using testing. Pets are stored in the 'pets' map using their names as keys.

Created a VirtualPetShelterApp which allows the user to interact with pets in the shelter. It starts with four cats and the user can interact with them as well as bring new cats or aduopts a cat. THis is implemented using a game loop.
